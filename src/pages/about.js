During his days in the financial industry, Jacques traveled the world and discovered that the best food, anywhere in the world, could be found in restaurants that had a limited menu. With the hamburger being one of his favourite foods, Jacques frequented many hamburger spots during his travels. Back home in Toronto, the inability to find a well-made classic hamburger was particularly frustrating to him. Despite Toronto being a hub for restaurants, and hamburgers, he simply could not find the delicious old-fashioned fresh burger he was seeking. It felt as though restaurants were trying too hard to be different and innovative, overcomplicating a simple concept."
